Everything happens in the ConnectScene. Ultimately it should do the connection in this scene then Load a scene on the MasterClient when all players are ready

The NetworkController handles the connection. Once both players are connected, it tells the GameManager to start the game.

The GameManager begins by telling the GridManager to generate the grid on MasterClient. Once it's done, it gets the indexes where there are green chips and sends it to the 
other player via an RPC. The client can then begin generating its own grid with these infos

GameManager handles the game flow RPCs. It's kind of the hub for any action we wanna take in the game.
BetManager handles the calls related to betting.
Both of them need each other so it would be more interesting to use dependency injection, but I didnt have the time to set it up

The GameManager on the MasterClient ensures the players cannot bet more than they have so the Client cannot cheat by sending corrupt data.

Flow:
1. Player adds/remove Tokens that they wanna be (AddTokenToBet/RemoveTokenFromBet in GameManager)
2. They select a chip to bet on (SelectChip in GameManager)

Notes: 
- Somehow, the UserId of players was null for the client on both Master and client. That's why I'm using ActorNumber instead which seems to be working.

Compute earnings
Check turn before betting ( UI and MasterClient )
